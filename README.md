This software tool for systems biology provides a way to view TCGA data from a gene-centric point-of-view. It includes a number of interactive visualizations, and allows the user to save their current exploration. This application also enables the user to select specific cancers and genes of interest, and load data that is generated from a variety of TCGA analysis.

All software is presented AS IS to the general community.  Our priority is to continuously improve the software to serve research in systems biology and computational biology.
